## Inspiration
What a bizarre world we’re currently living in! For women who are pregnant, this can be a particularly emotional and stressful time. Taking some time for one’s own mental and physical health is very important and for most, this should include exercising. 

With current restrictions, most of us don’t have access to gyms or professional trainers so we resort to exercise by following online content (fitness apps, youtube videos, etc).

Now, the problem with this is that exercise, if not done correctly can do more harm than good. Incorrect posture could cause joint pain, back pain, and propose some serious health concerns for the mother and the baby.

Keeping all these points in mind, we came up with an app for pregnant women where they can follow an exercise regime: as you follow the exercise, the app keeps a check on your posture. If at any point your posture is incorrect, the app instructs you on how to correct it. All this happens in real-time, as you exercise.

Apart from this, we added two more key features which include:
 A chatbot backed up by AI which answers your health-related question
And a blogs section where you can find certified articles about exercise and lifestyle during pregnancy.
